in one min person on an average blinks 12 to 15 times 

the average duration of one blink is around 100 to 150 ms
1 second is equal to 1000 ms


the average webcam produces 30Fps

How much long is one frame 
1000 / 30 = 33ms
the blink will span for 5 frames 


the gap between each frame is 33 ms

if u have the gap of 100-150ms between the frames u will lose a blink


for example if we have 15Fps 
we will have a gap of 66ms between each frame 
the blink will span for 2 frames approax
this is well below the average blink duration 
so that we have totally 15 * 60 = 900 frames to process in a minute

hence proved 
we will skip alternate frames
