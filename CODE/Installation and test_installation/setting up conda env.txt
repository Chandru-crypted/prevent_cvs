[ click start 
search anaconda prompt 
then in the right there will be options for opening as administrator click it
copy each code from here 
and right click there that's it

after runnig a code wait for a feww minutes and if it asks y/n press y] 

we will create a new environment 

$ conda create --name prevent_cvs python=3.7

$ conda activate prevent_cvs

for installing open cv i checked in pyimage search itself, but it did not have 
support for windows OS 
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/opencv-tutorials-resources-guides/ 

so i checked another website 
https://www.roundsqr.com/computer-vision-getting-started/ 

so will be following the commands in the above website for installing

$ conda update --all

$ conda install -c conda-forge opencv

wait for 15 min 

$ conda update --all 

$ python -m pip install https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/0e/ce/f8a3cff33ac03a8219768f0694c5d703c8e037e6aba2e865f9bae22ed63c/dlib-19.8.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl#sha256=794994fa2c54e7776659fddb148363a5556468a6d5d46be8dad311722d54bfcf
